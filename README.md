This project will soon be obsolete!
-----------------------------------
I am working on a new music player (codename: Project Mousou) which will be put on GitHub once it has a name, and then I will add a link to it here ASAP.

Sky Jukebox will recieve one final update to fix an OGG playback bug before it becomes obsolete. The installer problem will not be fixed.

**Sky Jukebox only works on specific builds of Windows 10 Insider Preview. Works on build 10122 and 9926 only!**

**It is recommended use Sky Jukebox on Windows 7 only, since the design is better there, and all the features -should- work there.**

Uses the 3rd-party libraries NAudio, NAudio.Flac (modified code from CSCore), NVorbis, NAudio.Vorbis, Extended WPF Toolkit Community Edition, DirectoryInfoEx, TagLib#, Octokit, MidiUtils (modified version).

System Requirements:
--------------------
  * Microsoft Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1, 32/64-bit (tested on 7 & 8.1), Windows 10 Insider Preview (build 10122 and 9926 only)
  * **Recommended OS: Windows 7**
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1+
  * Note: M4A, AAC, ADTS are only supported on Windows 7 and higher. AC3 is only supported on Windows 8 or higher. All other formats are supported on any version of Windows.

Notable features:
-----------------
**Open Source:** Completely free and open-source. Licensed under the GPL.

**Compact:** Uses only ~3MB of disk space.

**Easy to use:** Many features are developed with a focus on convenience and simplicity. (Some things still need to be learned though)

**Non-Intrusive:** The player window is small and supports Aero Glass. It can even be minimized to the system tray. (Global "HotKeys" will be implemented in future releases)

**Customizable:** Every icon can be replaced using a skin, icons can be recolored, the background colors can be changed, the scrolling text can be customized, etc.

**Support for file types:** Plays many kinds of files, and even more can be added by plugins. Built in support for MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, OGG, FLAC, M4A, AAC, ADTS as well as M3U / M3U8 playlists.

**Performance:** Performance optimizations are WIP, but currently the performance is pretty good. The plan is to ensure UI responsiveness whenever possible.

Experimental MIDI playback using [MidiUtils](https://github.com/nanase/MidiUtils).

*Planned features: Localization, Tag Editor, audio conversion, Minecraft Intergration plugin (maybe) and more...*
