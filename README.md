System Requirements:
--------------------
  * Microsoft Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10, 32/64-bit
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1+
  * Note 1: I have no intention of supporting Windows XP.
  * Note 2: Sadly, WPF is not cross-platform, nor is there any cross-platform implementation or alternative to it. Therefore there might not be a cross-platform version for a long, long time.
  * Note 3: M4A, AAC, ADTS are only supported on Windows 7 and higher. AC3 is only supported on Windows 8 or higher. All other formats are supported on any OS.

Notable features:
-----------------
**Open Source:** Completely free and open-source. Licensed under the GPL.

**Compact:** Uses only ~3MB of disk space.

**Easy to use:** Many features are developed with a focus on convenience and simplicity. (Some things still need to be learned though)

**Non-Intrusive:** The player window is small and supports Aero Glass. It can even be minimized to the system tray. (Global "HotKeys" will be implemented in future releases)

**Customizable:** Every icon can be replaced using a skin, icons can be recolored, the background colors can be changed, the scrolling text can be customized, etc.

**Future-proof:** Designed with WPF, tested on Windows 10 Technical Preview as well as Windows 7 and 8.1.

**Support for file types:** Plays many kinds of files, and even more can be added by plugins. Built in support for MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, OGG, FLAC, M4A, AAC, ADTS as well as M3U / M3U8 playlists.

**Performance:** Performance optimizations are WIP, but currently the performance is pretty good. The plan is to ensure UI responsiveness whenever possible.

*Planned features: Localization, Tag Editor, MIDI support, audio conversion, Minecraft Intergration plugin (maybe) and more...*
