Sky Jukebox
===========

Compact, powerful music player. (Currently WIP = not-so-powerful)

Uses 3rd-party libraries NAudio, NVorbis, TagLib#, FlacBox, LAME, Managed ListView.

System Requirements:
--------------------
  * Microsoft Windows Vista/7/8/8.1, 32/64-bit (works with Aero Glass mod for Win8.1)
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1
  * Note 1: I have no intention of supporting Windows XP.
  * Note 2: Sadly, WPF is not cross-platform, nor is there any cross-platform implementation or alternative to it. Therefore there might not be a cross-platform version for a long, long time.

Notable features: (List is not final)
-----------------
  * Open a playlist in one click and play it. Supports M3U, M3U8.
  * Use the Playlist Editor to add songs to the list and organize them, and save the playlist in M3U format.
  * Compact Aero Glass WPF GUI (stays on top). Each button has a tooltip which describes it.
  * Dynamically change the color of the icons!
  * You can now choose the playback device!
  * You can minimize the player to the system tray to continue playback in the background.
    Double-click the system tray icon to open it again or right-click it for more options.
    Tray icon does not remain visible after exiting!
  * Correct shuffle mode: move backwards and forward within the temporarily shuffled list
  * Supports almost all major audio formats: Wave, MP3, Ogg-Vorbis, WMA, AIFF, M4A, FLAC and more!
  * NEW: Codec plugin support! Developers can add support for other audio formats! Look at the FLAC plugin code.
  * WORK IN PROGRESS: A lot of stuff planned. Some examples: MIDI playback, High-resolution mode, Minecraft intergration plugin / mod, more customization options, localization support, more playback features, ID3 tag / metadata editing, convert audio, skins ...

Alpha version download (built 06-Oct-2014): http://www.mediafire.com/download/bp0p0qi62md9v4o/Sky_Jukebox_v0.8.0_Alpha_06-Oct-2014.zip
Rumor has it that this alpha isn't working on Win8.1 but I still need to test it.
